* pgdevdb

Pgdevdb is a bash script that creates a postgres database and user
(with password) from one command. The purpose is to be able to create
test postgres users and databases on the fly for testing and
development.

** Usage

Pgdevdb takes on command, and uses the first argument as the postgres
username, the password for that user, and postgres database. The user
is made an owner of the database.

Example usage:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        λ pgdevdb mytestdb
    #+END_SRC

Pgdeveb also handles deleting users and databases with the `-d` flag
in the command before the name:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        λ pgdevdb -d mytestdb
    #+END_SRC

This command will drop the user and database that we created in the
first command.

To login directly to the sql shell of `mytestdb`:

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        λ pgdevdb -l mytestdb
    #+END_SRC

** Installation

Git clone the repo and add it to your path, or clone the repo and run
it will something like `sh`.
